**Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions**

**Objective:** Learn to spot and remove potentially harmful browser extensions.

**Tools:** Any web browser (Chrome, Firefox)

**Deliverables:** List of suspicious extensions found and removed (if any)

**1. Opened our browser’s extension/add-ons manager.** 

You may find this option on the top-right corner of your chrome brower (Just beside the gmail option)

**3. Check permissions and reviews for each extension.**

We got the permissions like:

a) Read and change all your data on all websites.

b) Read your browsing history.

c) Manage your Downloads.

d) Communicate with cooperating native applications.

**To get the reviews for each extension, we visited “Chrome Web Store”:**

**4. Identify any unused or suspicious extensions.**

**6. Restart browser and check for performance improvements.**

After removing a suspicious Chrome extension and restarting the chrome web-browser can lead to noticeable performance improvements, including:

a)	faster website loading times, 

b)	less memory usage, and 

c)	a smoother overall browsing experience. 

Malicious extensions can drain resources and slow down the browser, so removing them can significantly enhance your online experience. 

**7. Research how malicious extensions can harm users.**

o	Data Theft:
Malicious extensions can access a wide range of user data, including browsing history, login credentials, payment information, and personal details.

o	Tracking and Surveillance:
Can track user activities, collect information about browsing habits, and even monitor user keystrokes. 

o	Malicious Code Injection:
Malicious extensions can inject harmful code into websites, potentially modifying the content of web pages, redirecting users to phishing sites, or stealing sensitive information. 

o	Phishing Attacks:
Malicious extensions can mimic legitimate extensions or inject fake prompts to trick users into revealing their personal information. 

o	Performance Issues:
Some extensions can consume significant system resources, slowing down the browser and potentially impacting overall system performance. 

o	Installation of Malware/Spyware:
Malicious extensions can install malware or spyware on the user's device, leading to further security vulnerabilities and privacy breaches. 

**8. Document steps taken and extensions removed.**

1.	Opened our browser’s extension/add-ons manager. 
2.	Reviewed all installed extensions carefully. (chrome web browser)
3.	Checked permissions and reviews for each extension. (chrome web store)
4.	Identified any unused or suspicious extensions. 
5.	Removed suspicious or unnecessary extensions. (Shazam Extension)
6.	Restarted browser and check for performance improvements. (faster loading and less memory usage)
7.	Researched how malicious extensions can harm users.
